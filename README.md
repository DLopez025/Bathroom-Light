# Bathroom-Light
Code Represents a Simulated Bathroom Light in which movement is created through a photoResitor causing a light to go on for about 20 seconds. If the photoresistor catches movement then light is reset to 20 seconds. Light can also be activated through a button
which carries two functions if button is pressed when light is on then Light Bulb turns off for 10 seconds. This takes priority over the photoresistor allowing no action to turn the light bulb back on.
